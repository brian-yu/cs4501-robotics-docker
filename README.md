# CS4501 Robotics Docker Setup

This repository contains a docker setup for running [CS 4501 Robotics for Software Engineers](https://less-lab-uva.github.io/CS4501-Website/) labs. With this setup, users can access GUI applications such as `rviz` and `rqt` using their browser. It also uses a docker volume to store the lab code, so users can edit the lab code on their host machine using their IDE of choice.
